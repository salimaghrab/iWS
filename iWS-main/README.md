<h3>Description :</h3>
<br>
The Smart Weather Station project is designed to monitor and predict weather conditions using multiple sensors and LoRa communication. This system collects real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed/direction, persisting the data for later analysis and visualizing it on a dashboard. Additionally, the system includes a weather forecasting feature based on historical data and trends.
<h3>Objectif:</h3>
The main objective of this project is to create a real-time weather monitoring system that can:

Accurately measure and log environmental data such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind conditions.
Persist data in a secure and accessible format for future analysis.
Display weather data on a user-friendly dashboard, providing clear visualizations and insights.
Enable weather forecasting using historical data and simple trend analysis.
Use LoRa communication for long-range, low-power data transmission between sensors and the central system.
<br>
<h3>Features:</h3>
Temperature and Humidity Measurement: Collects real-time data using DHT22 sensors.<br>
Rainfall Precipitation Measurement: Tracks rainfall using a rain gauge sensor.<br>
Wind Speed and Direction Monitoring: Uses appropriate sensors to capture wind data.<br>
LoRa Communication: Long-range, low-power communication between sensors and base station.<br>
Data Persistence: Stores sensor data in a local or cloud database for long-term access.<br>
Dashboard Visualization: A web interface that displays current and historical weather data.<br>
Weather Forecasting: Provides future weather predictions based on trends in collected data.<br>
<br>
<h3>Requirements :</h3>
BME620 temperature and humidity sensor <br>
Rain gauge sensor for precipitation measurement <br>
Wind speed and direction sensors <br>
LoRa module (for long-range communication) <br>
Microcontroller (ESP32) <br>
